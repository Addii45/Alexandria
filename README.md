## Problem we are addressing
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us all indoors and this has caused massive changes to our daily lives, changes that have often happened rapidly and abruptly.

This has hit the education sector really hard, especially those studying at universities. Class have become meetings and while professors trying their best to adjust to the “New Normal” of online classes, they still aren’t entirely comfortable with teaching online. This of course is no fault of their own, change is hard.

However, this has led to students often getting frustrated as they unable to understand concepts or cope up with the curriculum. This problem is also amplified by the fact that students are unable to discuss with their friends like they did back on campus.

Student like ourselves are in dire need of academic help. So, we as aspiring engineers thought of a clever way to solve this problem.



## Solution!
We were reminiscing one evening about how we used to learn difficult concepts by bouncing resources off each other and asking each other even the silliest of doubts. This led to us having an epiphany, “why don’t we just do this but online”?
So, we’re building Alexandria, a platform built by students, for students.
