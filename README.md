## Problem we are addressing
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us all indoors and this has caused massive changes to our daily lives, changes that have often happened rapidly and abruptly.

This has hit the education sector really hard, especially those studying at universities. Class have become meetings and while professors trying their best to adjust to the “New Normal” of online classes, they still aren’t entirely comfortable with teaching online. This of course is no fault of their own, change is hard.

However, this has led to students often getting frustrated as they unable to understand concepts or cope up with the curriculum. This problem is also amplified by the fact that students are unable to discuss with their friends like they did back on campus.

Student like ourselves are in dire need of academic help. So, we as aspiring engineers thought of a clever way to solve this problem.



## Solution!
We were reminiscing one evening about how we used to learn difficult concepts by bouncing resources off each other and asking each other even the silliest of doubts. This led to us having an epiphany, “why don’t we just do this but online”?
So, we’re building Alexandria, a platform built by students, for students.

Alexandria is a platform that allows students to ask and answer questions, share knowledge and teach others what they know. 
They can do this by creating repositories with the right resources laid out in a sequential manner that can help others learn effectively. 
Students can also ask the author questions they may have or share extra any information that he/she may know and this creates an atmosphere for a healthy discussion that benefits everyone on the platform.

To incentivise students to make repos, we introduced the concept of **BigBrain Tokens (BB’s)** - which are fungible tokens built on the Tezos Blockchain that act as currency on the platform. 

We as administrators can mint new tokens when necessary and send them to owners of the most upvoted repositories. Users can connect to their Temple Wallet accounts to receive these tokens and then can choose to send tokens to other owners of repositories they like. 
This way, there is a legitimate incentive for students to contribute and share knowledge and this creates a healthy atmosphere of learning on our platform.

Here are some sample screenshots of BigBrain tokens that are being minted and sent to a test account. </br>
**The 'Mint BB Tokens' option only appears when the administrator is making a transaction**
